# `AstrophysicalCalculations.jl`

_Common equations within modern astrophysics!_

## Overview

This package provides equations as they're written in Caroll and Ostlie's 
_An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics_. For now, all of the documentation exists
within each function or constant's docstrings. Check the sidebar for functions and 
constants grouped into modules by their underlying assumptions and content.
