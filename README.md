# `AstrophysicalCalculations.jl`

_Common equations within modern astrophysics!_

## Overview

I am currently working through Carroll and Ostlie's _An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics_.
As I read each chapter, I'm writing key equations here. This is an educational tool, but
will also allow me (and others) to explore the concepts through computation later. 

## Installation

This package is not-yetÂ registered.

```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/cadojo/AstrophysicalCalculations.jl
```

## References

All equations and constants are pulled from Carroll and Ostlie's _An Introduction to 
Modern Astrophysics_. Equations are grouped by their underlying assumptions. See the 
BibTeX citation below for Carroll and Ostlie's textbook.
